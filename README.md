# Glaucoma-Prediction-using-SVM-in-Matlab

This project seeks to develop a dependable tool for ophthalmologists and healthcare workers,
aiding early identification and treatment of glaucoma and, eventually, preventing visual loss in
affected patients. Combining image processing with SVM creates a strong foundation for
glaucoma detection, improving the accuracy and efficiency of early diagnosis and leading to
better patient outcomes. This project seeks to develop a trustworthy tool for ophthalmologists
and healthcare providers by using the capabilities of digital image processing and machine
learning, aiding early identification and treatment of glaucoma and, eventually, preventing
vision loss in afflicted patients. This study uses MATLAB and digital image processing
techniques to give a complete approach to glaucoma illness prediction. The main goal is to
create a system that can accurately identify glaucoma by evaluating retinal pictures. The
procedure consists of many critical steps: image acquisition, preprocessing, segmentation,
feature extraction, and classification. Combining image processing with SVM creates a strong
foundation for glaucoma detection, possibly improving the accuracy and efficiency of early
diagnosis.
